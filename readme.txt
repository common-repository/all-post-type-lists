== Description ==

In WordPress, a post type is a way of categorizing different types of content on a website, such as blog posts, pages, or custom content types. A post type lists plugin provides a way to display all the posts of a specific post type in a list format on a WordPress website.

There are several post type lists plugins available for WordPress, each with its own set of features and customization options. Some of the common features of these plugins include the ability to:

1. Display post lists that are registered from themes and plugin
2. Display the slug of each post type.
3. Display registered taxonomy for each post type.

These post-type lists plugins can be useful for various purposes, such as showcasing portfolio items, displaying a list of events or products, or creating a directory of businesses. By providing an easy way to organize and display content on a website, post type lists plugins can help improve the user experience and increase engagement.
